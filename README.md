# Entitas 2.0 - The Entity Component System Framework for C# and Unity
This is a Fork (or rather an entire remake at this point) of the [Original Entitas made by Simon Schmidt](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas) the main differences are a Roslyn-based Code Generator which regenerates as you type and an improved API rebuilt from the ground up for a nicer coding experience. There's also a bunch of performance improvements behind the scenes.
